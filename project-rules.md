   Additional Information
   • Documentation: All assignments should be uploaded to a public GitHub repository with a proper and
   well structured “README.md” file. Repository name is up to you to decide.
   • API Communication: The application should have at least two APIs (e.g., backend and frontend), but
   you can start with a single API and split as you progress
   • Production-Ready Quality: Focus on clean code, error handling, and logging
   • Other: There is no specific restriction on using third party libraries for the project. It’s important to
   choose your third-party libraries wisely so they don’t come with huge overhead in usage.
   Optional Enhancements
   • Containerization: Docker support is encouraged for deployment consistency
   • Testing: Writing unit tests
   • API Documentation:
   • Monitoring:
   • Advanced Identity: custom JWT implementation
